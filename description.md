# Response code definition

Commonly, for all APIs, the HTTP status codes should use those registered by IANA.
See: <https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml>

In OpenLoop, we should use a few well defined HTTP status codes as follow:

- `200`: Successful response. Refer to each API for the detailed response data.
- `400`: Return Bad Request.
- `401`: Unauthorized. Either API details are missing or invalid
- `403`: Forbidden - You do not have access to the requested resource.
- `415`: Unsupported media type. You need to use application/json.
- `500`: Exchange/SinoHope internal error.
